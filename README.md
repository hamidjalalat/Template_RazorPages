# ASP.NET Core Razor Pages Clean Architecture Template with .NET 7.x

### Old Repository Name: ASP.NET Core Razor Pages Template!

After 10 years experinse about development of CMS (Content Management System) and Identity (Custom Security), I developed a new version with .NET 7.x and ASP.NET
Core Razor Pages based on Clean Architecture and Clean Code.

In this project:

- I did not use Identity Server, event Microsoft Identity, I used pure security
- This project is absolutly multilingual but at the first time I create this project in two languages:
  - English
  - Farsi (Persian)
- This project has two main Features:
  - CMS
  - Identity

In CMS (almost) all of items are dynamic:
- Page
- Post
- Slide
- Layout
- Menu Item
- Post Category
- ...
  
I hope use it and enjoy it
